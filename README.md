Abstract
========

##### Introduction

Traffic-related air pollutants (TRAPs) are associated with multiple negative health outcomes, but the precise biological mechanisms are largely unknown. In this report, a cross-sectional study of a twin cohort from the Netherlands (n=2,438) was analysed to attempt to identify the molecular signature of TRAP exposure at a transcriptomic level. Exposure levels for seven of the most commonly studied TRAPs and a number of metallic elemental particles were modelled using land-use regression; transcriptomic data were acquired from blood samples; further data were acquired by questionnaire.

##### Methods

Univariate regression of all transcripts on all TRAPs, adjusted for confounders, was used to identify transcripts that were significantly associated with TRAP exposure. Multivariate methods were used to examine the role of elemental particles. Stability analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the results to input data and model specification. Unsupervised machine learning was used to cluster the data set across a number of different dimensions, and exposure--transcript relationships were analysed within clusters. Bioinformatics and functional analysis were used to propose biological pathways to phenotypic outcomes.

##### Results

A total of 374 transcripts were identified as significantly associated with exposure to PM2.5 (p\<0.05). Associations were found to be strongest among residents of less urban areas, with lower exposure levels. The genes most significantly differentially expressed were ZNF791, BTBD1 and OSBPL8, which were upregulated, and WIPF2, which was downregulated. Sensitivity analysis found the results to be robust. Weaker effects were observed in men and in the 28--33 age cohort. Clustering revealed stable clusters within the data relating to exposure levels, geographical variables and demographic variables, and provided a potentially useful mode of stratification for further analysis.

##### Discussion

Functional analysis showed significant perturbation of phosphoprotein and alternative splicing pathways, which have been used as biomarker predictors of tumour growth and cancer treatment success. Increased effects in women supports previous research indicating women are more severely affected by air pollution than men, although no conclusions can be drawn about whether the effect is biological or behavioural/environmental. Clustering methods suggest a useful adjunct to traditional analytical methods in computational epidemiology, and highlight some weaknesses in land use regression for exposure modelling.
